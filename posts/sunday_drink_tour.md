# sunday drink tour

last sunday, i went on a drink tour with my friend arvin, my girlfriend audrey,
and my dog, lily. we started off our day with a visit to namaste in park slope,
where we indulged in some delicious lassi. although this wasn't my first time
trying lassi, i have been craving it lately, especially with the warmer weather.

after our refreshing drink, we took the q train to manhattan. it was lily's
first time on the train, and she managed i guess. our first stop was kopitiam,
where we got to try bek-kopi, a special type of white coffee with condensed
milk. the coffee wasnâ€™t sweet which i liked but the condensed milk really hit
the spot. also the coffee in the bag was weird but was kinda nice because you
could hold it by the string or holes without actually warming the drink up or
having the drink sweat all over your hands. probably easier for them to ship
that as well but i digress.

as we continued our journey, we were all getting kinda hungry and audrey needed
something gluten-free to eat, so we made a quick stop at fong on for their sweet
tofu pudding. the pudding was light and there was almost no taste until we
realized the sugar syrup was very much needed haha. i thought it was pretty good
not sure i would reach for it over other food in chinatown. but if you like tofu
its for sure a must try.

our final stop was sugarcane daddy, where we got to enjoy freshly squeezed
sugarcane juice. the juice was sweet and refreshing, and a perfect ending to our
drink tour.

here are some pictures from our adventure:
